# Speech-To-Text-Implementations
Repo with TF 2.0 implementation of a Wavenet based architecture as well as a transformer based model. <br>
<br>
wavenet_main utilizes the TF 2.0 model based on the wavenet architecture for training on the [LibriSpeech](http://www.openslr.org/12/) dataset. <br>
transformer_main uses a transformer encoder-decoder architecture for the same.<br>
