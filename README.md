# Speech-To-Text-Implementations
Repo with TF 2.0 implementation of a Wavenet based architecture as well as a transformer based model. <br>
<br>
Utilizes the TF 2.0 model based on the wavenet architecture for training on the [LibriSpeech](http://www.openslr.org/12/) dataset: <br>
```bash
$ python3 wavenet_main 
```

 Utilize the transformer encoder-decoder architecture for the same:<br>
 ```bash
$ python3 transformer_main
 ```
<br>
